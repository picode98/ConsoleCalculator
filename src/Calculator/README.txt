This folder contains a Visual Studio 2017 (v15) solution that can be used to build and test Console Calculator. It contains the following projects:

"Calculator - Alternate" - Builds Console Calculator as an executable. It has this name because it was started from scratch after the first implementation's parser failed to function properly.

"ConsoleCalculatorTests" - Unit tests for Console Calculator.

NOTE: To significantly reduce download size, the downloadable source code contains only a subset of Boost 1.67.0 created using BCP (www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/tools/bcp/doc/html/index.html). If you wish to add further Boost dependencies, replace "Libraries/boost" with a full copy of Boost (www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_67_0.html).


This release of Console Calculator is GPL licensed; see LICENSE.txt for details.
